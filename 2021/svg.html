          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) describes graphics in a way that is
          scalable to different device resolutions in a manner that is
          accessible, stylable, and scriptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SVG WG maintains the deliverables listed in this charter. They
          consist of the following technologies, all of which are in scope for
          the SVG Working Group:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <dfn>syntax</dfn> for retained-model structured graphics. Both
          XML and HTML syntaxes are supported and CSS is used for styling.
          </li>
          <li>A <dfn>rendering model</dfn> which describes how SVG elements are
          rendered.
          </li>
          <li>An <dfn>object model</dfn> and set of APIs, to support scripting
          and user interaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The SVG WG's focus in this charter period is on <em>maintenance</em>
          and <em>interoperability testing</em> of the core SVG 2
          specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a secondary focus, the group may address modules for new graphical
          features for SVG, once there is broad consensus on adding each such
          feature to the Web Platform. The SVG Community Group (and also any
          other fora, such as WICG) will incubate new proposals. Once an
          incubated proposal is implemented and available (in nightly or
          testing builds) in at least one major browser, and has support from
          other SVG implementers, it may be adopted by the SVG Working Group. A
          requirements document will be used to collect together these
          features.

            Success Criteria
          </h3>
          <p>
            To be successful, the WG shall continue to work with the
            W3C/Developer Community to actively address open issues with
            group's deliverables.

            The W3C Process Document governs the progression of the normative
            specifications along the W3C's Recommendation Track, including
            adequate implementation experience requirements. Specifications
            that reach <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsW3C">W3C
            Recommendation</a>, are considered successful when all of the
            following are present:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed
            in the Deliverables section.
            </li>
            <li>Test suites for each module with conformance criteria.
            </li>
            <li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable
            implementations of each feature with conformance criteria in each
            deliverable; as demonstrated by an implementation report
            (summarizing implementation status against the relevant test suite)
            for each testable class of product, including user agents.
            </li>
            <li>Deployment on multiple types of platform.
            </li>
            <li>User community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.

          Each normative specification should contain a section detailing all
          known security and privacy implications for implementers, authors,
          and end users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each normative specification should contain a section on
          accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways
          specification features can be used to address them, and
          recommendations for maximizing accessibility in implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be testing plans for each normative specification,
          starting from the earliest drafts. The SVG WG will follow a <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">test as you
          commit</a> approach to specification development.

                This specification defines the features and syntax for Scalable
                Vector Graphics (SVG) Version 2. SVG is a language based on XML
                for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster
                graphics. SVG content is stylable, scalable to different
                display resolutions, and can be viewed stand-alone, mixed with
                HTML content, or embedded using XML namespaces within other XML
                languages. SVG also supports dynamic changes; script can be
                used to create interactive documents, and animations can be
                performed using declarative animation features or by using
                script.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more
          active participants for its duration, including representatives from
          the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and
          Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors,
          and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per
          week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for
          other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public
          mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href=
          "#communication">Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
          submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent
          Policy</a>.

          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a id=

          issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">
          public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
          meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
          discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can
          be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public
          repository and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
          meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be
          available from the <a href=

          home page.</a>
        </p>

          Most SVG Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of
          particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed
          basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C
          Process Document</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes
          an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members
          of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little
          formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week
          to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
