	  <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML </a>
is a markup language for encoding and sharing mathematics.The need for mathematical rendering on the web
was evident from the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_45.html">earliest days of the Web at CERN</a>,
and MathML was among the first specifications taken up and developed by the W3C in the mid/late-1990&#39;s XML/XHTML era. It received much attention and has created a vibrant ecosystem of implementations and integration outside of web browsers, and it advanced on the Web itself becoming integrated, along with SVG into the HTML Parser and the HTML Specification in the mid 2000s. Since then, much has happened. While MathML has much
success with making math accessible
and has had wide adoption by the tools used to generate and consume math, browser adoption is not universal. The MathML 3 specification does not match some current Web realities; it does not contain precise enough requirements for interoperability within the Web Platform; and some features are either incompatible with or subsumed by new features added to the Web Platform outside MathML.
</p>

      <section id="scope-inscope" class="scope">
        <h3>Scope</h3>


<p>
The MathML Refresh Community Group (CG) was formed to revise MathML to address perceived deficiencies in the spec. The MathML Working Group will advance, refine, and clarify the work begun by the MathML Community Group and ensure MathML&rsquo;s relevance continues to evolve, grow and improve. In particular, there are three goals the group hopes to advance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Wide adoption by browsers of a core set of presentational elements so that authors can be assured that math will be displayed similarly in all browsers without having to rely on external libraries to do the display.
</li>
<li>
Increased accessibility of Presentation MathML for both
mathematics and chemical formulas by allowing a means 
of specifying relevant semantics in-place, as well as providing guidelines for interpreting Presentation MathML in the absence of specific semantics.
</li>
<li>
Ensuring that mathematical formulations are searchable.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Working Group will begin by providing a thorough review and refinement of MathML Core Level 1, a restricted form of MathML created by the MathML Community Group, which has done the initial hard work of largely aligning with features of the platform and precisely defining its rendering, including integration with CSS and basic DOM, providing tests and opening bugs.
</p>
<p>
The Working Group will take up new work, such as problems the CG identified as requiring better solutions in order to move MathML in the Web Platform forward, in MathML Core Level 2.
</p>
<p>
The Working Group will also overhaul MathML 3 building upon these fundamentals and experience with needs for accessibility and with many years of practical experience and use (or lack thereof), to create a path forward as MathML 4.
</p>
<p>
The scope of the MathML Working Group includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Development of Recommendations as outlined above.
</li>
<li>
Development of a test suite to check conformance of implementations.
</li>
<li>
Clarifications to the current use of Web Platform technologies, such as supported JavaScript APIs and CSS modules.
</li>
<li>
Enhancements and improvements to internationalization.
</li>
<li>
Continued integration of errata and bug fixes.
</li>
<li>
Integration of new and existing Web Platform technologies, including, but not limited to:
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hyperlinks</li>
<li>DOM APIs</li>
<li>Shadow DOM and Custom Elements</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Integration with tools above and beyond browsers</li>
<li>Improvements to the MathML markup and processing model to enhance accessibility and searchability</li>
<li>Identification of normative requirements needed to ensure accessibility</li>
<li>Removing elements and attributes from MathML that have had minimal adoption</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="section-out-of-scope">
  <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Adding new elements for use exclusively outside the platform
</li>
<li>Changes that would cause legacy MathML that has significant usage to stop working on the Web Platform or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Changes to Content MathML. These will be considered at a later time after gaining experience and feedback from proposed additions to enhance accessibility and searchability in Presentation MathML.</li>

<p>This specification provides an initial integration into the Web Platform with increased implementation details, focusing on a subset of MathML 3 which has had wide implementation and fits well with the platform. It details and relies on automated Web Platform tests to improve MathML interoperability. It provides the core layer of MathML support upon which MathML 4 can build, and authors can implement remaining features (by polyfills), or more generally extend MathML Core, using modern web technologies.</p>

The MathML WG will request reviews and coordinate, and may nominate liaisons to ensure that these groups are aligned and working in concert toward accessible mathematics.</dd>

	    <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/">ARIA Working Group</a></dt>
	    <dd>The ARIA Working Group is responsible for the development of ARIA and related Accessibility Mappings. The MathML WG will appoint a liaison and coordinate with the ARIA Working Group to provide the
<a href="">MathML AAM</a>
and continue to improve the accessibility of that which is part of MathML.

	    <dd>The Publishing Working Group goal is to enable all publications to be first class citizens of the web. MathML is used by a large number of technical and textbook publishers in their workflows. The MathML WG will work with the PWG to ensure their needs are met with updates to the MathML recommendations.</dd>

	    <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG Working Group</a></dt>
	    <dd>The SVG Working Group is responsible for the development of
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">SVG</a>.
While largely non-overlapping technically, the two share similar origin stories and are both unique in their integration with the HTML Parser specification and integration as
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html%23embedded-content-category">embedded content</a>.
As such they have many similar challenges and efforts to align with the larger Web Platform and share common interests in proving common developer experiences and expectations. The MathML Working Group will make attempts to coordinate furthering these efforts together with the SVG Working Group (and the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/svgcg/">SVG CG</a>).

	    <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/chem-web-pub/">Chemistry for the Web and Publishing Community Group</a></dt>
	    <dd>Chemical Formulas make use of mathematical notations. The Chem CG is concerned about the accessibility challenges of using math notations and having them spoken and brailled appropriately. The Math CG has worked with the Chem CG to ensure appropriate access to chemical formulas and the MathML WG will continue this effort.</dd>

This may have an influence on the future evolution of MathML. Efforts to align MathML Core with the Web Platform may lead to alignment requirements for these (new IDL, focusability, support for ideas like ShadowDOM, support for attributes, etc), in which case these should be explored further together with the WHATWG (and the

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math">MathML Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most MathML Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work  on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from 10 to 20 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

          This Working Group operates under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (Version of 5 February 2004 updated 1 August 2017). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.

          If the Director approves the proposed <a href='https://www.w3.org/2020/06/DRAFT-PP2020.html'>W3C Patent
            Policy (Draft dated 23 June 2020)</a>, without making subtantives changes following the <a

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
